/*
	pointer: pointer points the address of variable. It is denoted by *variable.
	Pointer is user-defined data type.
	for example :-
			int *a;
			int b=8;
			a=&b;
			In above example *a is a integer pointer.
			'a' shows address of variable.
			so here, 'a' points address of variable 'b'.
			so finally *a=8.
			note :- to print address use %u
