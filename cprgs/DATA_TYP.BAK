	data types
		-domain in which we can store the data

			-integer
				a) short
				b)int
				c)long
			-floating numbers
				a)float
				b)double
			-character
				a)char
	There are two tyes of type casting
		-implicit type
			a)type casting done automatically
			b)small data type automatically type casting large data type.
		-explicit type
			a)type explicit casting is done forcefully by user.
